[technology-description]
void-miners-electric-void-mining=A basic Electric Void Ore Miner. While not any faster than a Burner Void Miner, it can use absic catalysts and can create more materials.
void-miners-advanced-void-mining=With more advanced production, you can create more advanced materials and use more powerful catalysts while increasing speed.
void-miners-nuclear-void-mining=By using the power of nuclear technology you no longer need catalysts to create materials.
void-miners-stone-carbon-mixture=A basic, solid catalyst that can be used to create materials more efficiently than using stone.
void-miners-fluid-stone-carbon-mixture=An advanced, liquid catalyst that can be used to create materials more efficiently than stone or a Stone Carbon Mixture.

void-miners-no-catalysts=No Catalysts/Ingredients

[mod-setting-description]
void-miners-classic-mode=Enables the old classic graphics on the miners. Useful for nostalgia and other commerical uses outisde of Video Production. MIT license applies to this Graphics mode.
void-miners-no-catalysts=Disables the need of catalysts/ingredients for all miners when enabled. Catalyst items/fluid and recipies are left intact so you do not lose them when changing between modes, so you can toggle it on and off as much as you want.
